<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
<p>I am a Senior Business Analyst in the financial risk space, blending quantitative and qualitative methods to deliver valuable insights. I specialize in bringing order to chaos by transforming unstructured ideas into structured final products tailored to stakeholders' needs. With a knack for solving complex financial and risk-related problems, I thrive in ambiguous situations that require high-stakes decision-making. </p>
 
<p>To deepen my expertise, I recently earned an MS in Business Analytics from William & Mary, focusing on AI, Machine Learning, SQL, big data, and optimization. I am particularly interested in leveraging data to navigate financial risk, global markets, and international trade dynamics. </p>

<p>Beyond my analytical work, I am passionate about making complex global issues more accessible. This led me to write the book <i>The New International Volunteer: A Hands-On Guide to Sustainable and Inclusive Development</i> (Toplight Books, 2023), which examines international development through a data-driven and systems-thinking lens. My passion for global finance and risk analysis extends into my data work, where I build projects for See the World With Dataâ€”a portfolio exploring global finance, economic risk, and cross-border investments through real-world data-driven insights.</p>
